InsertionSort

Insertion sort is most effective when the array is already partially 
sorted and when there are not many elements of the array. 
If there are less than 10 elements, then this algorithm is the best. 
An array of the 1st element is considered sorted.

MergeSort

Inside, it uses recursion, which complicates the algorithm.
The complexity of the algorithm is logarithmic. O (n log n)

Merge Sort uses more memory than Insertion Sort
